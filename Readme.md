# Virtual Land NFTs

## 1. Project Title
**Virtual Land NFTs on Stacks Blockchain**

## 2. Project Description
This project implements a **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** system on the Stacks blockchain for representing ownership of virtual land plots in a metaverse environment. Each plot of land is assigned a unique ID and can be owned, transferred, or traded on-chain. The contract is written in **Clarity** and provides a minimal interface for minting new land plots and checking ownership.

## 3. Project Vision
The vision of this project is to **digitally represent land ownership in virtual worlds** using blockchain-based NFTs, ensuring transparent and verifiable property rights. These NFTs could form the basis for decentralized virtual real estate markets, gaming ecosystems, and metaverse projects.

## 4. Future Scope
- Adding a **buy/sell marketplace** for virtual land plots.
- Enabling **plot metadata** (e.g., coordinates, size, description).
- Adding **transfer functions** for land trading between users.
- Implementing **rental and leasing mechanisms** for virtual properties.
- Integrating with **metaverse platforms** to visually represent land ownership.
